    "The following learning outcomes apply to this piece:\n",
    "- **LO3** - Demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding of descriptive and predictive data analysis methods, optimization and search, and knowledge representation.\n",
    "- **LO4** - Formulate and extract descriptive and predictive statistics from data\n",
    "- **LO5** - Analyse and interpret results from descriptive and predictive data analysis\n",
    "- **LO6** - Apply their knowledge to a given problem domain and articulate potential data analysis problems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit the following items:\n",
    "- The notebook `Assignment_1_2023_uXXXXXXX.ipynb` (where uXXXXXXX is your uid) \n",
    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. You will also need to add your details below. Any variation of this will result in a `zero mark`.\n",

    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is strongly advised to read the whole assignment before attempting it and have at least a cursory glance at the dataset in order to gauge the requirements and understand what you need to do as a bigger picture.\n",
    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them. Leave it blank if you don't have anything to write.\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`. Remember to document your code using comments and doc strings as appropriate.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* You will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted.\n",
    "* Comment your code.\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupyter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of sea ice in polar regions is of great importance due to the critical role that sea ice plays in global climate and ecosystem health. Sea ice covers vast expanses of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, acting as a reflective surface that helps regulate the Earth's temperature by reflecting sunlight back into space. As such, changes in sea ice cover (herein, we refer it to as sea ice extent) can have significant impacts on global climate patterns and ocean currents. Sea ice also provides a critical habitat for a wide range of Arctic and Antarctic marine species, including krill, polar bears, and various species of seals. The health and abundance of these species are directly linked to the extent and duration of sea ice cover extent. Furthermore, sea ice serves as a major transportation route for commercial shipping and resource extraction. Given these factors, the study of sea ice in polar regions is essential for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change and ensuring the long-term sustainability of polar ecosystems and human societies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus of this assignment is to conduct a some basic data analysis of sea ice extent in the polar region. The analysis will be centered on the study of a given data set (SeaIceExtent.csv). Through this study, the goal is to gain a preliminary comprehension of how sea ice extent is changing in the polar regions over time. The analysis will involve the use of statistical tools and techniques to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data, as well as to develop models, particularly, linear regression models, that can help predict future changes in sea ice cover. The findings of this study will be potentially valuable in informing policy decisions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as in guiding the development of sustainable strategies for managing polar resources and ecosystems. Overall, this assignment represents an important effort to contribute to our understanding of one of the most critical and rapidly changing aspects of the Earth's climate system. With all this in mind, I hope you find joy in engaging with this assignment beyond simply completing it.\n",

The goal is to build useful models (keep in mind that \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\", a quote by George Box) for forecasting the evolution of the sea ice extent. For this purpose and for simplicity, we focus on Antarctic region (only use data from the year 1980 to 2022 for the Antarctic sea ice except for Task 5 below). Herein, we use the data generated in Task 5.1. Specifically, the tasks are below.\n",

To achieve this, we must determine the slopes and y-intercepts of these four line segments for 2022 using linear regression analysis.
