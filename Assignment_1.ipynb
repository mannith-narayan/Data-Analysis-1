    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of sea ice in polar regions is of great importance due to the critical role that sea ice plays in global climate and ecosystem health. Sea ice covers vast expanses of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, acting as a reflective surface that helps regulate the Earth's temperature by reflecting sunlight back into space. As such, changes in sea ice cover (herein, we refer it to as sea ice extent) can have significant impacts on global climate patterns and ocean currents. Sea ice also provides a critical habitat for a wide range of Arctic and Antarctic marine species, including krill, polar bears, and various species of seals. The health and abundance of these species are directly linked to the extent and duration of sea ice cover extent. Furthermore, sea ice serves as a major transportation route for commercial shipping and resource extraction. Given these factors, the study of sea ice in polar regions is essential for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change and ensuring the long-term sustainability of polar ecosystems and human societies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus of this assignment is to conduct a some basic data analysis of sea ice extent in the polar region. The analysis will be centered on the study of a given data set (SeaIceExtent.csv). Through this study, the goal is to gain a preliminary comprehension of how sea ice extent is changing in the polar regions over time. The analysis will involve the use of statistical tools and techniques to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data, as well as to develop models, particularly, linear regression models, that can help predict future changes in sea ice cover. The findings of this study will be potentially valuable in informing policy decisions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as in guiding the development of sustainable strategies for managing polar resources and ecosystems. Overall, this assignment represents an important effort to contribute to our understanding of one of the most critical and rapidly changing aspects of the Earth's climate system. With all this in mind, I hope you find joy in engaging with this assignment beyond simply completing it.\n",
